v0.1: Proof of concept. Can detect&delete blocks and blinkers.

v0.9: First working version. Able to count and delete the top 8 most common ash object, leaving the interesting ones behind.
Input bounding box: 1000x1000

v0.9.1: Fixed the bounding box problem, the max bounding box it can handle is now well over 5000x5000, theoretically 64235*64235
