# Cinis-Inquisitio

Cinis Inquisitio is a simple Conway's Game of Life ash cleaning/analyzing program that works with Golly, written in C++ by Wish Lin

- This program can analyze the ash left behind by a soup or reaction, erase the 8 most common ash objects(block,blinker,beehive,loaf,boat,ship,tub and pond), and output a cleaned ash for further inspection.
- Besides cleaning ashes, the program also documents how many times those 8 still lives appear, alongside some other data such as population and density.

v0.2 note: This version of the program is still in not optimized yet, thus it can only deal with ashes with a bounding box smaller than 1000x1000, anything bigger than that will almost always result in it crashing.

This size limit will be improved in the next version once it is more optimized.

Depending on your computer's efficiency, the program may take a while to finish the analyzing.

v0.2 Release date: 2021/12/11
