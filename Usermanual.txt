Before everything begins, first you would have to download Golly, a Conway's Game of Life simulator(which you probably already do if you want to use this toolkit in the first place)
Other programs that output RLE format when you copy patterns from them should also work, but I haven't tried those, so no guarantees can be made.

Also I am not an English native speaker, so please forgive me if I make any langauge related errors. Thank you.





Step 1: Copy the ash you want to analyze

The ash should have a bounding box smaller than 1000x1000 for this version(sorry for the inconvenice)

*********
When copying the ash, you need to leave some space at all four sides, which means no ash object should be directly in contact with the selection border. 
This is to prevent unexpected errors during the analyzing process since C++ arrays are weird in out of bound regions.
*********




Step 2: Run "Clear.exe" to clear the I/O txt's datas from the last run.

*I/O txt: input(RLE).txt, input(Plaintext).txt, Statistics.txt, Output.txt*



Step 3: Paste the ash you just copied in "input(RLE).txt"

You should open to a blank txt file and paste the ash's RLE file into it



Step 4: Run "RLE2PT.exe"

This converts the RLE format to Plaintext and you should see the previously blank "input(Plaintext).txt" becomes filled.

**If input(Plaintext).txt remains blank, then it means RLE2PT.exe crashed, and you would need to select a smaller portion of the ash, smaller than 1000x1000. 





Step 5: Run "Main.exe"

This is the analyzing program. Wait for it to finish.





Step 6: The result

Open "output.txt" to see the cleaned ash in Plaintext format. You can press Ctrl+A to select the entire pattern then copy it back to Golly for further investigation.

Open "Statistics.txt" for the statistics of the ash analyzed by the program.




Done! Thank you for using my program!
